# Part II: Method
## Current Limitations and Expansion of Boundaries:

- The existing paradigm in financial data analysis faces limitations primarily related to the overwhelming volume and complexity of data in the dynamic world of finance. Traditional methods struggle to keep pace with real-time demands, hindering swift and accurate decision-making. The computational demands of large language models (LLMs) also pose a challenge, limiting their practical deployment in finance. The proposed research seeks to expand these boundaries by introducing the Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA) technology. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and LLMs by reducing computational overhead while maintaining efficacy, thus enabling real-time finance information analysis. The integration of LoRA represents a novel and promising solution to bridge the existing gaps in financial data analysis.

## Uniqueness for Achieving Milestones:

- The unique qualities that position this research for a significant milestone in human civilization lie in its interdisciplinary approach. By combining advancements in natural language understanding and financial analysis, the study leverages cutting-edge technologies like LoRA to address a critical need in the financial sector. The researchers' expertise in both artificial intelligence and finance uniquely positions them to navigate the complexities of developing a real-time finance information analyzer. Their understanding of the challenges in finance, coupled with their proficiency in adapting state-of-the-art technologies, places them at the forefront of innovation in the intersection of AI and finance.

## Intellectual Significance and Practical Implications:

- The intellectual significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize the field of finance. Introducing LoRA as a bridge between LLMs and real-time finance data analysis represents a novel and pioneering contribution. The practical implications are substantial, empowering financial professionals with enhanced tools for decision-making. The research promises faster and more accurate analyses, impacting areas such as asset management, regulatory compliance, and risk assessment. By advancing the capabilities of financial analysis, the study contributes not only to academic knowledge but also addresses practical challenges faced by professionals in the finance industry.
## Significance:
- Nobel Prize in Economics: "For pioneering the integration of large language models with LoRA technology, revolutionizing real-time financial analysis and decision-making."
- Turing Awards in Computing: "For exceptional advancements in adapting AI methodologies to solve real-world finance challenges, notably introducing LoRA for enhanced computational efficiency in large language models."
